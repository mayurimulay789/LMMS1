# Progress Tracking Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Count the number of lessons in a course
- [x] Calculate progress percentage based on completed lessons / total lessons * 100
- [x] Update progress when lessons are completed (via POST /api/enrollments/progress)
- [x] Fetch progress for each enrolled course (via GET /api/enrollments/progress/:courseId)
- [x] Display progress on MyEnrollmentsPage with progress bars and percentages
- [x] Handle course completion (100% progress) and certificate generation

## Key Files Involved
- **Backend**: `server/routes/enrollment.js` - Progress calculation and update routes
- **Frontend**: `client/src/Pages/MyEnrollmentsPage.jsx` - Display progress UI
- **Redux**: `client/src/store/slices/enrollmentSlice.js` - Fetch and store progress data

## Progress Calculation Logic
- Total lessons = course.lessons.length
- Completed lessons = enrollment.progress.completedLessons.length
- Percentage = Math.round((completed / total) * 100)
- When percentage >= 100, course is marked as completed and certificate is issued

## Features
- Progress bars showing completion percentage
- Next lesson indication
- Automatic certificate generation on course completion
- Progress persistence across sessions
